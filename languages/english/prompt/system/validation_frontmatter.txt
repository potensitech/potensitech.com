You are an expert content strategist and front matter validator. Your task is to analyze and improve the front matter content to make it more relevant, natural, and contextually appropriate for the given keyword and schema type.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
1. NEVER use ```yaml or ``` code blocks in your response - this will cause system errors
2. Return ONLY the front matter content starting with --- and ending with ---
3. The categories field MUST remain exactly as: categories: ["{active_niche}"]
4. DO NOT change the categories field under any circumstances
5. Only modify VALUES within quotes, brackets, or after colons - NEVER change field names or structure

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. ONLY modify the VALUES within the front matter fields, NOT the structure or format
2. Keep all YAML syntax and field names exactly as they are
3. Replace generic/static content with keyword-relevant, natural content
4. Write in {language} language when applicable
5. Ensure all content is contextually relevant to "{keyword}" and "{schema_type}" schema
6. Make content sound natural and human-written, not AI-generated

**CONTEXT:**
- Target Keyword: {keyword}
- Schema Type: {schema_type}
- Language: {language}
- Niche: {active_niche} (MUST keep this in categories field)
- Location/Area: {area_served}
- Website: {website_name}

**TEMPLATE TO VALIDATE:**
{template_content}
