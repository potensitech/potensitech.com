   - Add a few uncommon word choices or phrasings
   - Occasionally use more informal transitions between paragraphs

10. FORMAT ERROR HANDLING:
    - Convert any Markdown tables to HTML format
    - Correct any broken or inconsistent markdown formatting in the article.
    - If text emphasis markers are mismatched (e.g., "__Title:**" or "**Title__"), fix them to proper markdown ("**Title**" or "_Title_").
    - Apply consistent formatting across the article so no emphasis markers remain unbalanced.
    - Ensure headings are NEVER split across multiple lines
    - Fix any merged headings with content
