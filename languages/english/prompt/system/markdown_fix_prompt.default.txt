Fix the incorrect markdown formatting in the following content:

ISSUES TO FIX:
1. Mixed bold/italic format: **text__ or *text_
2. Incorrect heading format: **## Title** -> ## Title
3. Broken table format with excessive underscores
4. Trailing underscores at the end of formatting: **text___
5. Inconsistent formatting within a single document
6. CRITICAL: Headings merged with paragraphs without proper line breaks
7. CRITICAL: Incorrect heading hierarchy - first main heading after intro should be ## (h2), not ### (h3)
8. CRITICAL: Split headings where heading text is broken across multiple lines
9. CRITICAL: Headings that are accidentally formatted with bold inside the heading syntax

FIXING RULES:
- Use **text** for bold (consistently)
- Use *text* for italic (consistently)
- ## Title for heading level 2
- ### Title for heading level 3
- CRITICAL: The FIRST main heading after the opening paragraph should ALWAYS be ## (h2), not ### (h3)
- Subsequent headings should follow logical hierarchy: ## for main sections, ### for subsections
- Tables must have a consistent | column | format
- Table format MUST be valid markdown: each table row starts and ends with |, and the number of columns is consistent in all rows.
- Table headers must be separated with a --- line as per markdown standard.
- Do not leave underscores, spaces, or strange characters at the start or end of table rows.
- If a table is broken, fix it so it renders correctly in a markdown viewer/Hugo.
- Remove excessive trailing underscores
- Keep formatting consistent throughout the document
- CRITICAL: Separate headings/subheadings (##, ###, etc.) from paragraphs: if a heading is directly followed by a sentence/paragraph on the same line, move the heading to its own line and start the paragraph on the next line.
- CRITICAL: Ensure there is always a blank line after headings before the next paragraph starts.
- CRITICAL: Fix split headings - if a heading is broken across multiple lines, merge them into a single line

HEADING HIERARCHY RULES:
- After the opening paragraph, the FIRST main section should use ## (h2)
- Major sections should use ## (h2)
- Subsections under major sections should use ### (h3)
- Sub-subsections should use #### (h4)
- Never start main content sections with ### (h3) - this creates improper hierarchy

SPLIT HEADING FIXES:
- If you see patterns like:
  ```
  ## 1. **Xiaomi 13T 
  
  Pro** – Power Meets Elegance
  ```
  Fix to:
  ```
  ## 1. **Xiaomi 13T Pro** – Power Meets Elegance
  ```

- If you see patterns like:
  ```
  ### 2. Samsung 
  Galaxy S24 Ultra – Luxury Redefined
  ```
  Fix to:
  ```
  ## 2. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra – Luxury Redefined
  ```
  (Note: Also convert ### to ## if it's the first main heading)

YEAR EMPHASIS:
- If the article mentions a year (except for history or old data), ONLY use the year {current_year} for all contexts of updates, trends, prices, recommendations, and the latest information.
- Do not use years other than {current_year} except for history, launch year, or historical data.
