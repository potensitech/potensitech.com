### Fast-Charging Support

In today’s fast-paced world, quick charging is a must.  Durable batteries should support fast charging without compromising their lifespan. Sony incorporates intelligent charging technologies to balance speed and longevity.

### Thermal Management

Excessive heat can damage batteries and reduce their lifespan. Effective thermal management systems, like those found in Sony smartphones, prevent overheating during intensive tasks such as gaming or video streaming.

Sony’s commitment to innovation ensures their smartphones deliver on all these fronts, making them a top choice for anyone seeking durability and reliability.
