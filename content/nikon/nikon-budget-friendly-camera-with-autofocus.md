## Exploring Autofocus Technology

Autofocus is one of the most sought-after features in modern cameras, and Nikon has perfected this technology in its budget-friendly models.

Both methods ensure seamless operation, allowing photographers to focus on their creative vision rather than technical adjustments.

### Why Autofocus Matters for Beginners
