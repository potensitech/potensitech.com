- **Compact Design**: Their smaller size and lighter weight make them ideal companions for travel photography or long shooting sessions.
- **Creative Control**: Wide apertures enable beautiful background blur (bokeh), making subjects pop against soft backgrounds—a technique cherished by portrait photographers.
