The phone’s frame is crafted from **100% recycled aluminum**, and the internal components incorporate rare earth elements sourced responsibly.

This eco-conscious design doesn’t just benefit the planet; it also enhances the device’s durability. The Potensians can feel good about owning a smartphone that aligns with their values while standing up to the rigors of daily use.
